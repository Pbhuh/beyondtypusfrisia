# Do not change tags in here without changing every other reference to them.
# If adding new groups or cultures, make sure they are unique.

# Union tags do not suffer from the 'same_culture_group' tax penalty.
# Primary tags are the first choice for rebel factions seeking cultural independence.

# graphical_culture = westerngfx
# second_graphical_culture = muslimgfx (fallback if the first does not exist)

#Note all BtP and BT cultures are now moved into the main culture file in the interest of improving the auto-generated colours, hopefully preventing the recurring issue of little-no distinction between different cultures' colours.

#Yes, I know, the modular nature of different files is a better modding practice and better etiquette. Yes, I know this may, in extreme cases, make already incompatible mods more incompatible. Yes, I know it makes things harder to fnd in a giant file like this. Yes, I know it makes using a compare program to spot vanilla changes that much more difficult.
#In the end, the trade-off for hopefully more consistant culture colours will hopefully outweigh the downsides, the mods this affects are already incompatible, it is already long past the point where ctrl-f  is a must anyway, and it is also long past the point where this file can be compared directly to a vanilla file.

#All new additions to old culture groups should be searchable using the following terms:
#Beyond the Pale Culture (HR's work, sometimes modded by BT),
#BtPLegacy Culture (BT work in the Old World), or
#Beyond Typus Culture (BT cultures in the New World or Oceania).
#While all new culture groups can be found at the bottom of the file, marked with headers for the file they're pulled from.
